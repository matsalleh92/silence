* Chris' extremely concise guide to building GTK+ applications *
****************************************************************

-Definitions- 
IDE: Integrated development environment. The things we hate: visual studio/eclipse etc etc

GTK+: This is the name of the widget library, ie the thing that actually draws the stuff on the screen and says what function

GTK2: Version two of the GTK+ library (we probably won't use this)

GTK3: Version three of the GTK+ library (we will likely use this). The two have slightly different implementation ideologies. GTK3 uses CSS and other cool stuff and is designed to look good on 4K screens

Glade: A tool to make designing the GUI easy. ie, what button goes where etc. All this program does is create something like a HTML file that says where each button goes and what function to call when it's pressed etc. For example, you might draw a button and set the on_click property to btn_call(). When the application is running it will call btn_call() but you don't actually define that code in Glade. Remember how everything in linux/unix land does it's one job very well? Glade isn't an IDE or compiler - it's ONE job is to generate this XML file.

Event-driven programming: This is fortunately how Glade works, and whaat you're used to. It means that functions are called when events happen. Ie, you call btn_call() when you click on something. (At least this is how it appears to the programmer, in actuality it doesn't work like that)

gcc: A compiler that takes C code and converts it machine code. Gnu C Compiler

Geany: Text editor

-General Process-
1) Draw a bunch of shit in Glade and assign the correct labels and stuff
2) Write some code in Geany that opens up your glade code
3) Compile said code and run it

-Compile Options-
***********************
* IMPORTANT! READ THIS*
***********************
Geany runs gcc for us which is handy. It passes a bunch of default options. Like all programs in unnix/linux this is done with something called switches at the command line which just means you place a dash, - , after the command. For example: someProgram -someSwitch 

For some reason that I don't fully understand (yet) you need a bunch of options/switches to actually get a GTK+ program to compile. You can set these options in geany by clicking the arrow next to the brick and clicking build settings or something.

At time of writing I don't have access to Geany, but by default it will probably be something like this:
# gcc -Wall -o "%e" "%f" (something like this)
This means, run gcc, show all warnings (-Wall), output (-o) it to "%e" (geany code for the name of the executable), using input file "%f" (weird Geany syntax for current file).

Here's the options you need to add:
`pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` (without a dash, but with those back ticks), see reference [2]
-pipe 
-pthread
-rdynamic see reference 3 of that these do

Your geany command might look something like this:
gcc -Wall -rdynamic -pipe -pthread `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -o "%e" "%f" (something like this)

-Dependencies-

You will obviously need libraries to compile this. In ubuntu (I think) they are the following package names:
libgtk-3-dev
